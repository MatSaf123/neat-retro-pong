# Master's thesis: Reinforcement Learning in Simulations

Using Neuroevolution of Augmented Topologies (NEAT) in Python in order to solve problems in simulations provided by OpenAI Gym library.

# TODOs
- [x] Re-implemented Pong with use of OpenAI Gym
- [ ] Setup jumanji (based on OpenAI Gym)
- [ ] Try to implement BinPack 3D environment

# Random (?) notes
- On Linux I also needed `sudo apt install swig`, and I did `pip install box2d-py` manually as well.
